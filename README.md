This DAX code is a Power BI query that retrieves information about measures and tables in a Power BI dataset and combines them into a structured table for analysis.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

VAR _measures: This variable stores information about measures using the INFO.MEASURES() function. It selects columns for the measure's name, description, DAX expression, and the ID of the table the measure belongs to.

VAR _tables: This variable stores information about tables in the dataset using the INFO.TABLES() function. It selects columns for the table's ID and name.

VAR _combined: This variable combines the information from _measures and _tables using the NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN function, which performs a left outer join operation based on the common column "TableID". This operation combines the measures with their respective tables based on their IDs.

RETURN: This section returns the combined table, selecting columns for the measure's name, description, DAX formula, and the name of the table where the measure belongs. The SELECTCOLUMNS function is used to rename the columns for clarity.

Overall, this DAX code efficiently retrieves and combines information about measures and tables from a Power BI dataset, providing a structured view of the dataset's schema and allowing for further analysis and exploration.
